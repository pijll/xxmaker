The designer of the game 1800, Antonio Leal, has given permission for anyone to design components for the game,
and to manufacture their own copy of the game.

"I give permission for anyone to design and post components for 1800 on boardgamegeek. I am very pleased with
what has been done so far. I also give permission for anyone to download my files and make games for themselves.
If someone wishes to produce some sets and distribute them, it is OK with me provided that the total price is
for materials and postage only- no profit or "handling". I hope that players will use 1800 as an introduction
to the great 18xx series of games. Antonio Leal" (https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1785984/permission-granted)
